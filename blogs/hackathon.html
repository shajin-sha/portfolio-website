    <h4>What was hackathon about?</h4>
    <p>It was on topic : Health issues faced by society üß¨ in today's world.</p>

    <br />

    <h5>Rules and regulations of the hackathon</h5>
    <p>1. Max 4 members in a team (I was alone)</p>
    <p>2. 12 hours hackathon</p>
    <p>3. Can use any software technology (I used Flutter + Python + Node)</p>
    <p>4. No age limit (I was 17 years old)</p>
    <p>5. No need to be an student, can be an employee or anyone</p>

    <br />


    <h5>Highlights of me at hackathon</h5>
    <p>1. I was the only school student in the hackathon</p>
    <p>2. I was the only one who was alone in the hackathon</p>
    <p>3. I was youngest in the hackathon</p>
    <p>4. I do't have any prior experience in hackathon (it was my first hackathon)</p>
    <p>5. I was not good at public speaking or pitching my idea to judges</p>

    <h5> Do you need to have any prior experience by participating in hackathon?</p>
        <p>No, I didn't have any prior experience in hackathon. I just had an idea and I implemented it planing plays and major rule.</p>


        <br />

        <h5>What was my expectation before hackathon? </h5>
        <p>I was not even expecting to win the hackathon. I just wanted to participate and learn something new and network with people.</p>
        <p>But I do spend a lots of time to plan and validate my idea and product</p>

        <br />

        <h5>What was my idea?</h5>

        <p>My idea was to build an app that can track diseases and provide personalized health recommendations with live diseases spreading map and tracking</p>

        <h6>Potential of my idea</h6>
        I can track and find the diseases spreading in my area and I can take precautions to prevent it or even I can get personalized health recommendations based on my health condition and diseases spreading in my area.
        <br>
        <br>
        We are trying to fill gap in commutation of medical team and common person and sociality



        <br />

        <h5>What was my plan?</h5>

        <p>1. I planned to build an app that can track diseases and provide personalized health recommendations with live diseases spreading map and tracking in side an map</p>
        <p>2. Giving dashboard and API for medical institutes and hospitals</p>
        <p>3. Giving dashboard and API for government</p>
        <p>4. Giving dashboard for Parasitical companies & small medical stores for understanding the demand of medicines and medical equipment</p>

        Yes, I was unable to implement all this within 12 hours. But I was able to implement the core idea and I was able to win the hackathon.


        <br />
        <br />



        <h5> Do you really need public speaking skills to win hackathon?</h5>
        <p> May be, I don't know. But I was an normal person (OR kind of introvert) and I was not good at public speaking. But I was able to win the hackathon. but was able to express all my ideas and thoughts to the judges and audience. I was able to convince them with my idea and product.</p>


        <br />


        <h5>Team work or individual work?</h5>
        depends on the hackathon. Some hackathon allows team work and some hackathon allows individual work. In my case, I was alone and I was able to win the hackathon.
        But I would recommend to have a team. Because you can divide the work and you can build the product faster also meet your negatives with your team members positives.
        <br>
        <br>

        Then why not I had a team? I was not able to find a partner, I BEGGED in many of participants to join me. But no one was ready to join me. So I was alone üòâ.


        <br />
        <br />

        <h5> Who are my competitors?</h5>
        <p>College students (B.Tech, BCA etc..)</p>
        <p>I am not sure is there any employee or not, because this hackathon was in hybrid mode (online + offline) and I was not able to see all the participants in online mode.</p>

        Yes, I am the only school student in the hackathon. I was competing with college students. But I was able to win the hackathon.
        <br>
        <br>
        Yes, I am youngest in the hackathon.
